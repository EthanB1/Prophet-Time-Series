# Prophet-Time-Series

### In this scenario, I'm a growth analyst at Mercado Libre. With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I've been tasked with analysing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to help the company grow.
### In a bid to drive revenue, I’ll produce a Jupyter notebook that contains my data preparation, my analysis, and visualisations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. I’ll use text and comments to document your findings. And, I’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this notebook will contain the following:

#### Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

#### An evaluation of how the company stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.


#### A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.


#### Answers to the questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter notebook.
